# React and React Native
This is the code repository for [Building Bots with Node.js](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/react-and-react-native), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebookâ€™s innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base!
### Instructions and Navigations
All of the codes are organized as per the chapters, each folder has the codes related to that chapter or appendix.                   
For example: React-and-React-Native/Chapter02/html-tag-conventions/main.js

Also, you can refer to Instruction folder in the repository placed at: React-and-React-Native/Instruction/, to understand the codes used in the repository.

The code will look like the following:
```
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
import { 
  AppRegistry, 
  View, 
} from 'react-native'; 
 
import styles from './styles'; 
 
// Imports our own platform-independent "DatePicker" 
// and "TimePicker" components. 
import DatePicker from './DatePicker'; 
import TimePicker from './TimePicker';
```
